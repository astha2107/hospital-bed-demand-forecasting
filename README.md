# 🏥 Hospital Bed & ICU Demand Forecasting – Excel Project

### 📌 Goal
During pandemics or infection surges, hospitals need to anticipate ICU bed demand before shortages occur. This project builds a lightweight forecasting and scenario modeling system using **Excel**, focused on four Indian states.

---

### 📊 What I Built

- Cleaned and merged two datasets:  
  → Daily COVID-19 cases per state  
  → State-wise hospital bed availability

- Built time series forecasts for new COVID cases using `TREND()`  
- Estimated daily ICU bed demand (5% of new cases)  
- Performed What-If Analysis at +10%, +20%, +50% surge scenarios  
- Highlighted ICU bed shortfalls across 4 major Indian states  
- All done 100% in Excel — no code, no external tools

---

### 🧠 Key Insights

- All four states (Delhi, Gujarat, Kerala, West Bengal) **currently face ICU shortfalls**
- Even a 10% surge leads to significant demand–supply gap
- Kerala and West Bengal are at higher risk based on forecasted trends
- Proactive resource planning is crucial in outbreak situations

---

### 📁 Tools Used
- Excel (Data Cleaning, Forecasting, What-If Modeling)
- Public COVID-19 case data + hospital bed data
- `TREND()` function for manual forecasting
- Spreadsheet formulas (TREND, IFERROR, ROUND)
